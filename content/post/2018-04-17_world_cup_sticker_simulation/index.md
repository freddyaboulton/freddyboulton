Having grown up in Latin America, the Panini World Cup Sticker Album is a sacred tradition carried out by soccer fans of all ages. People buy sticker packs and trade their repeats with strangers in the hopes to fill out the entire album - the most recent one had over 600 stickers! I wanted to figure out:

1. How much one should expect to pay to fill out the album on average
2. How one's tendency to repeatedly trade with the same people impacts their expected cost to complete the album.
