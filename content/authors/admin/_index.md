I'm a software engineer specializing in the intersection of open source software and artificial intelligence. I'm currently at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), where I spend most of my time developing [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), an open-source python package for building AI-powered web applications with little code.

Previously, I worked at the [Alteryx Innovation Labs](https://www.alteryx.com/innovation-labs) where I was a lead engineer on [EvalML](https://github.com/alteryx/evalml), a python package for automated machine learning (AutoML). I got my start in software at [Motional](https://motional.com/), developing tools to train deep learning models of driver behavior for autonomous vehicles. Out of college, I worked as a data scientist at [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/) leveraging thousands of hours of television viewing data to build machine learning models to calculate television ratings.
