I wanted to push my PyTorch skills and learn how to model sequences of data with a conditional random field. Sequence Models are tricky and were barely covered in my undergraduate education. It's my most popular Towards Data Science post yet! Read it [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/conditional-random-field-tutorial-in-pytorch-ca0d04499463).
