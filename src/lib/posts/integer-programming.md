While working at Nielsen, I was tasked with making the predictions of a machine learning model align with census estimates of a group of demographics in a region interest. Unlike most traditional optimization problems, where the answers can be real numbers, in this situation the answer is a yes or no (whether a certain individual belongs to a demographic group). The right tool for the job is integer programming. I summarize what I learned about this field, and how to use it in practice, [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/integer-programming-in-python-1cbdfa240df2).
