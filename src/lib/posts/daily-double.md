My first blog post! I wanted to really practice my python skills at a new project (I was just starting to learn) and analyze Jeopardy, one of my favorite tv shows. I was always curious about how a game that billed itself as testing the smarts of its contestants would let luck tip the scales by adding Daily Double questions. I wanted to estimate the effect the Daily Double had on the outcome of the game. I scraped Jeopardy data and presented my findings [here](https://medium.com/s/story/does-the-daily-double-determine-who-wins-on-jeopardy-465378725826).
